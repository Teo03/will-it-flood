                    Global climate change involves the rising of sea level around the world. This is driven by two primary
                    factors: the thermal expansion of water as it heats up, and the melting of ice at the poles increasing
                    the amount of liquid water in the oceans. The oceans currently rise at a rate of slightly more than
                    three millimeters each year.
                </p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>Approximately 40% of the entire human population lives in coastal areas, and eight
                    of the ten largest cities in the world are located on the coast. As sea level continues to rise, these
                    coastal areas will face increasingly severe impacts from hurricanes, storm surge, and flooding in
                    general, affecting billions of people.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>Although this issue is one of the first that comes to mind when considering the
                    effects of climate change, it is difficult to envision the effects of oceans rising by less than a
                    centimeter each year.</p>

                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment.
                    Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have
                    shifted and trees are flowering sooner.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>Effects that scientists had predicted in the past would result from global climate
                    change are now occurring: loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat
                    waves.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for
                    decades to come, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. The Intergovernmental
                    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more than 1,300 scientists from the United States and
                    other countries, forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>According to the IPCC, the extent of climate change effects on individual regions
                    will vary over time and with the ability of different societal and environmental systems to mitigate or
                    adapt to change.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>The IPCC predicts that increases in global mean temperature of less than 1.8 to
                    5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 3 degrees Celsius) above 1990 levels will produce beneficial impacts in
                    some regions and harmful ones in others. Net annual costs will increase over time as global temperatures
                    increase.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>"Taken as a whole," the IPCC states, "the range of published evidence indicates
                    that the net damage costs of climate change are likely to be significant and to increase over time."

                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>It’s true that the global sea level has been rising in the last two decades. The
                    satellite record since 1993 has revealed that the sea level was above the 1993 average in 2014 and
                    likely rise at higher rates in the coming years, posing a huge threat to the environment and the living
                    beings inhabiting it. The rapid growth in science and technology has led to the rise in carbon dioxide
                    and carbon monoxide emissions into the atmosphere, deteriorating our environment and ecology at a
                    significant pace.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>According to latest reports, it has been estimated that the world would see a sea
                    level rise of around 2.3 meters for each degree Celsius of temperature rise within the next two thousand
                    years. Researchers are also suggested that the sea level rise in some locations would be higher from
                    that of the global average because of local factors including subsidence, the difference in ocean
                    currents, erosion, and variations in land height, among others. However, the increasing sea level will
                    see deadly storms that enter inland than they did earlier, putting the lives of every single living
                    being on earth into risk.</p>

                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>These rising sea levels pose a major threat to island nations and coastal areas
                    meaning that these areas could be swamped and submerged by water anytime in the future. In countries
                    like the United States, where almost 40% of the population resides in coastal areas, the flooding due to
                    sea-level rise is expected to create adverse effects. Studies have suggested that the frequency of
                    disruptive flooding in the region is expected to increase from 300% to 900% compared to the frequency
                    recorded in fifty years ago. In order to invite the global attention to such a threat, the Indian Ocean
                    island nation the Maldives had conducted the world’s first underwater cabinet meeting in 2009. This
                    island nation’s 350,000 inhabitants are reportedly residing on 1,192 coral islands, which are located an
                    average of only 2.1m above the sea level.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>Additionally, because of global warming and the resultant rising sea levels, there
                    is a threat of extinction of several types of plants and animals which need and thrive only in the cold
                    climate. Animals like the polar bear and penguins essentially need the coldness for their existence and
                    due to our continuous abuse of carbon dioxide and monoxide gas, are the first ones to face the
                    possibilities of a sure-shot extinction. Besides these, the rise in sea level would also make an impact
                    on the lives on beaches. The presence of more saltwater on the shores will disrupt the ecosystem,
                    resulting in the vanishing of different kinds of plants. In addition to it would make to the soil and
                    plants, the wildlife on the beaches would also be damaged by the rapid changes in the climate
                    conditions.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>And if these animals are facing the threat of extinction, then humans living in
                    coastal areas and island nations also face the threat of getting submerged in case a deluge happens.
                    Rising sea levels could cause the water levels to increase and invade in the residential areas thus
                    causing a lot of problem to the locales. And unlike other natural calamities, where migration could
                    solve problems, in the case of rising sea levels and the expectant troubles, migration to other parts of
                    the world will be futile because every land form in the globe is bordered by in one way or the other.
                </p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>Since around 71% of the Earth’s surface is water-covered, one of the biggest
                    crisis that human and other beings on earth would face is the contamination of drinking water. Higher
                    sea levels mean the surge of to farther inland areas and contaminating drinking water sources.
                    Similarly, the contamination of freshwater sources would also affect irrigation and farming, eventually
                    leading us to a food crisis. And, the cost associated with the seawater desalination would make an
                    unsustainable practice to deal with the crisis.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>One of the immediate impacts of the increasing sea level on the economy would be
                    the threat posed the tourism industry. The frequent flooding and the destruction of beaches would break
                    the backbone of the tourism industry. Recently in North Carolina, US, the local authorities had
                    restricted coastal policymakers from using rising sea-level rise predictions to serve the economic
                    interests of the region.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>Since the total concentration of the water-bodies being more than two-thirds of
                    the earth, global warming and the rising sea levels are a serious problem that has to be tackled. A
                    natural calamity like the Katrina or the Tsunami that hit the coasts of the South East Asian Nations is
                    itself difficult to tackle. In a way, these calamities are restricted to just one part of the world, but
                    because of rising sea levels, the whole world stands to lose ground at a single time. And this is a
                    crisis that is occurring every day. Every day, little-by-little the glaciers in the Arctic and the
                    Antarctic are melting thus giving way to rising sea levels and a little less chance to experience living
                    for the future generation.</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>At the present moment, most of us are worried about the extinction of the tigers
                    and vultures, but with the development has led to an adverse effect on the environment, it has become
                    evident that even our survival in the future has become questionable. But, whether human innovations can
                    save the earth from an anticipated disaster remains controversial. Since there are more political and
                    social factors playing roles in this, the result of such efforts is unpredictable. However, in line with
                    the Paris climate accord, many countries across the world are working hard to cut greenhouse gases. We
                    should all ensure that it is quite possible that if we try and change, we can put an end to the problem
                    of global warming and rising sea levels. And since it is a question of need and wants, it becomes very
                    important that we change and start to respect and preserve our ecology and environment.</p>

                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>You already know the causes now it is time to know the effects from rising ocean
                    temperature which you can read below:</p>
                <p style={{fontSize: 20}}>
                    • Stronger Storms: Warmer oceans means stronger storms in the future. Different types of ocean such as
                    hurricanes and cyclones feed off warm temperature. They gain their energy from ocean’s warmth.
                    <br />
                    • Higher Sea Level: As the ocean becomes hotter and hotter, it will spread out and cause a higher sea
                    level. Rising ocean temperature is one of the causes of sea level rise.
                    <br />
    
                    • Melting Ice: An increase in the ocean temperature will cause the ice in the ocean to melt at a faster
                    rate than ever before.
                    <br />
    
                    • Destruction of Ocean Habitat: Some habitats are vulnerable to ocean temperature such as coral reefs.
                    Annually, many coral reefs experience bleaching due to rising temperature in the ocean.
                    <br />
    
                    • Death to Marine Creatures: Both marine animals and plants are at a very high risk of death when they
                    experience a rise in the ocean temperature. They are highly sensitive to the slight changes in ocean’s
                    condition. The destruction of ocean habitat due to warm ocean can also kill them off.
                    <br />
    
                    • Loss of Land: Many lands used for human settlements and recreations will no longer exist due to warmer
                    ocean temperature. As said before, warm temperature causes water to expand. All the water will take up
                    most of the land that human use.
